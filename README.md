# Modeling for Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond

Modeling for single NV centers in diamond.

Construct ground state Hamiltonian of NV-negative centers, including
fine structure, hyperfine structure, nuclear quadrupole,
and external magnetic field terms.

Includes transformation from lab frame to rotating frame.

Includes tools for plotting eigenvalues, plotting states on the Bloch
sphere (one must choose the two physical spin states to be
  represented), and representing states as linear combination of
  basis states.
